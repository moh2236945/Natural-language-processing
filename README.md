Advanced Neural Network implementation For text Classicifation and generator 
Predict next word and char 
the Complex proplen In readin with CNN is the arabic language that just because arabic letter alphaptic letter is in shape but when written we joined it together 
So if we read the text it will appear as letter not as word 
to slove this proplem we have to option 
1- store all the letter in different case (in first of the word in the middle in the end )
2- I didnt prefer to using NLTK to predict the word using BOW .instead of this Using RE library and joined prefix to join it 
The work under progress
